# Image and Video Object-Detection
In this notebook, a Computer Vision model for detecting object in images or videos along side bounding_boxes, is built using OpenCV. The model used here is the MobileNetSSD Caffe Model.

## Prerequisite
* Python 3.X
* OpenCv installed (cv2)
* Required Python packages: `Numpy Matplotlib`

## Setup
* Install necessary packages
  `pip install numpy`
  `pip install matplolib`
* Setup the model's config and weights path.
  `config_path = 'Model/path/to/config.prototxt'`
  `weight_path = 'Model/path/to/MobileNetSSD_deploy.caffemodel'`
